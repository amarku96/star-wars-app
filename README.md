This is a simple React application that allows you to explore Star Wars characters from the SWAPI (Star Wars API) and filter them by various attributes.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Install Dependencies:**

## Functionality
**Search:** Enter a character's name in the search bar to find specific characters. The search is not case-sensitive and can match partial names.

**Filtering**: Choose from filtering options such as name, homeworld, or species to narrow down the results. Select a filter option, enter the filter value, and the app will display characters that match the criteria.

**Character Details**: Click on a character's card to see more detailed information in a modal. This modal provides additional information about the selected character, including their height, mass, birth year, and more.
